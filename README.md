A friend of mine bought a Flux Wifi LED Light Bulb then I discovered [this guy's work](https://github.com/beville/flux_led) and of course, I had to try it out in a Clojure REPL.

[Quick Demo (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkaAoXwgLc)

The code is almost entirely based on beville's work so all credit goes to him or her.

Also, here's a [link to the light bulb](http://www.amazon.com/Flux-WiFi-Smart-Light-Bulb/dp/B00SGLKWQW) if you want to get one.
